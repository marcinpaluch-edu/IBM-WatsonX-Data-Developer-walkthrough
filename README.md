# IBM WatsonX Data Developer walkthrough
If you attended the IBM TechExchange event in Orlando this October (2025), you might have learnt on the new software from IBM: WatsonX.data Developer edition. 
Here is more information on this announcement online: [IBM launches watsonx.data developer edition: Free, local and ready to power your next prototype](https://www.ibm.com/new/announcements/ibm-launches-watsonx-data-developer-edition-to-power-your-next-prototype).

WatsonX.data is the new Data Lakehouse type of solution from IBM. Like this article explains [here](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/data-lakehouse), data lakehouse is a data platform that combines the flexible data storage of data lakes with the high-performance analytics capabilities of data warehouses. As it's part of the WatsonX family, it enables AI and ML on all data in one place. There are also other cool things it can do, and this article is about it. 

What's cool about this news is that the regular edition of WatsonX.data, the Enterprise Edition, is fully licensed or SaaS subscription-based, and now you can get the Developer Edition too, which is free, local and lets you play around the concept of the data lakehouse on your own laptop, before making any license purchase decision.

In this document I'll show in a step-by-step walkthrough form, all steps required to get the WatsonX.data Developer software installed on your Windows 11 laptop and start using it and make your first own experiments on Your data.
